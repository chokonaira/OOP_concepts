#INHERITANCE
* Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of another object

#POLYMORPHISM
* Polymorphism means many forms, it is a method of processing objects differently based on there data type.
  In other words it means, one method with multiple implimentations, for a certain class of action.
  Example:
  A car have a gear transmission system, it has four front gears and one reverse gear. When the engine is accelerated then depending on which gear is engaged, different amount of power and movement is delivered to the car

#ENCAPSULATION
* Encapsulation is a method in which the data of an object is not directly exposed, instead callers that want to achieve a given result are coaxed into proper usage by invoking methods rather tahn accessing the data directly.

#ABSTRACTION
* Abstractio hides certain details of an object and only shows the essential features of the object. Abstraction helps to reduce code duplcation.


#Constructor keyword
* The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class

#new operator
1. The 'new' operator creates a an empty javacript object.
2. Links(sets the constructor of) this object to another object.
3. returns 'this' if the object doesnt return its own object.

#Getter and setter
* Is used in encapsulation, to limit access to an internal state of an object

#function scope
* Varieble declared in a function are hidden from any code outside of its function

#Closures
* Closure is an inner scope which has access to all the variebles defined outside of its block
